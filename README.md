## Inter-Stitching Of Pictures based On Descriptors

This is a small program that can stitch two images together. It is short and easy to use, but not very accurate (at the moment). 
It is based on the SIFT algorithm, using the keypoint descriptors to find coinciding areas between images. 

### Installation

Download and install the package with the following command:

```console
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Isopod
```

The package contents can then be imported using

```console
from Isopod import isopod
```

### Usage

For correct usage please refer to the Jupyter Notebook in /Example.
